# Top-down learning path: Cybersecurity for a relatively senior Computer Engineering undergrad.

Inspired by [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) and [Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers).

## What is it?

This repository will be used to keep track of my study plan for learning more related to the cybersecurity field and become a security engineer myself.

My main goal is learning the fundamentals and understanding the basic foundations of the hacks/scripts I utilize but also being able to use them in a practical context. A personal goal is to leave college (December/2021) with a security engineer internship experience in one of the big-tech companies, like Google or Facebook.

Please, feel free to make any contributions you feel will make it better.

## Why use it?

I am using this with an organization purpose. I need to keep track of my learning and progress in order to keep my productivity high. I also believe using repos as study plan should be more common so I am making this public to encourage more developers to share their goals and study plans.

 It's a long plan. It's going to take me months, maybe years. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

## How to use it
Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.

- [x] Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]

## Follow me
I'm a brazilian Computer Engineer undergrad who is really passionate about programming and the complex dynamics of our technological world.

Since I am still an undergrad student I have plenty of free time (Nervously sweating). I plan to work on this study plan 3/4 hours per day in general, but that is a long shot.

I'm on the journey.

## About Video Resources

Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera, Udemy or EdX class. It is free to do so, but sometimes the classes
are no longer in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. I'm going to be adding more videos
from public sources and replacing the online course videos over time. I like using university lectures.

## The Daily Plan

For now, as I said before, my plan is to read about some new vulnerability and try a CTF challenge or study a theoretical notion about computer security everyday (Or at least watch a Mister Robot episode).
